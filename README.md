# Medified-Health-Assistant

Project for the submission of Tech Crawler Hackathon


Medified is an instant medical checkup service. It will predict the chances of getting disease to the patient by collecting patients health conditions as input.Using machine learning we built models for some diseases to predict health condition of the patient through a series of inputs from the patient.
